ðŸ’» Passionate about technology and innovation, currently in the second semester of the Systems Analysis and Development program. Focused on web development and system monitoring solutions, I'm always eager to learn more about programming languages and best development practices.

ðŸ”¥ I have experience in creating management and monitoring systems, such as a remote monitoring project for grain dryers. I'm also developing skills in C, particularly in Data Structures.
